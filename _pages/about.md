Hello there, I'm Maxime :waiving-hand:
I am an MEng student in France at CentraleSupélec where I mostly studied Applied Mathematics and Data Science. I am also working at AAICO as an ML Engineer intern. I am passionate about AI and Data Science and the applications to real-life issues. I love staying up-to-date with the latest advancements in research in these fields, and all the exciting new developments that are constantly emerging.
Through this blog, I will try to talk about the projects I did, or subjects I am interested in. I hope you'll enjoy it. :smile:
