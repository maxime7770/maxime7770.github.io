Hello, I'm Maxime and this is my blog
I am an MEng student in France and I am currently working at AAICO in Dubai as an ML Engineer intern. I am mainly passionate about AI and Data Science and the applications to real-life issues. 
Through this blog, I will try to talk about my projects I did, or subjects I am interested in. I hope you'll enjoy it. :smile:
