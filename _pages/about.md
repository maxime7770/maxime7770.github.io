Hello! :wave: I’m Maxime, a Machine Learning Engineer at PayPal. My work focuses on building and deploying machine learning models, particularly in recommendation systems and personalization.

I studied Data Science at MIT, where I worked on various projects at the intersection of optimization and machine learning. Previously, I collaborated with the MIT Operations Research Center and IBM, contributing to research at the intersection of Machine Learning and Optimization.

I have a strong passion for AI, especially in natural language processing, and I enjoy participating in hackathons and personal projects. You can find more details on my [GitHub](https://github.com/maxime7770).

I also write about Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Data Science on my blog. If you’re interested in discussing ideas or collaborating, feel free to reach out!

Feel free to reach out via email at [maximew@mit.edu](mailto:) or connect with me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maxime-wolf/).
