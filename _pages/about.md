Hello! :wave:  I'm Maxime, a Masters in Business Analytics (MBAn) candidate at MIT.

My academic focus is on machine learning and deep learning, where I am involved in collaborative projects that address complex real-world challenges. Additionally, I conduct research at the MIT Operations Research Center, specifically at the intersection of optimization and machine learning under the supervision of Professor Georgia Perakis.

I have a deep passion for AI, particularly in natural language processing (NLP), and have engaged in numerous hackathons and personal projects. You can find more details on my [GitHub](https://github.com/maxime7770).

You can also check out my blog where I share insights on Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Data Science. I'm always looking for new opportunities to collaborate on exciting projects!

Feel free to reach out via email at [maximew@mit.edu](mailto:) or connect with me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maxime-wolf/).
