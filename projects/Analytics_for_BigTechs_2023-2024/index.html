However, given that the world’s biggest tech players already have immensely capable analytic capabilities, an intriguing question is how they plan to further use analytics to advance their key priorities, ranging from short-term KPIs to long-term roadmaps.</p> <p>In this report, we aim to shed light on the future significance of analytics in the tech industry by focusing on key players and taking a deep dive into how specific data science techniques will be key to advancing their strategic goals.</p> <h3 id="case-studies">Case Studies</h3> <h4 id="google---ads-ai-retail-youtube">Google - Ads (AI, Retail, YouTube)</h4> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/analytics_bigtechs_2024/google-480.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/analytics_bigtechs_2024/google-800.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/analytics_bigtechs_2024/google-1400.webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/analytics_bigtechs_2024/google.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" title="example image" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Google Ads </div> <p>Advertising accounted for 80% of Google’s revenues in 2022 and is indisputably its top priority. During the 2023 Q3 earnings call, Philipp Schindler (SVP, CBO) stated that the “three key priority areas for Ads [are] Google AI, Retail, and YouTube”.</p> <p>Given the potential existential threat posed by AI-integrated information retrieval systems such as ChatGPT and Bing Search, it is unsurprising for Google to focus on accelerating the use of AI in Search. In Q2, Google announced innovations such as conversational experiences in Google Ads (using AI assistant to create new marketing content) and updates to Performance Max (automated bidding and budget optimization using AI). Further work on these features will involve Large Language Models even more powerful than the newly released Gemini (announced in Dec 2023), as well as creating a user interface that seamlessly blends traditional search with AI-generated replies for a multitude of potential use cases.</p> <p>On the retail side, it is focusing on introducing businesses with more pricing and inventory planning tools to handle an increasing number of “micro-peaks” expected during Q4, which features an extended period of heavy discounts. These may require tools such as optimization and reinforcement learning to learn the best strategy that maximizes rewards.</p> <p>Finally, AI helps not just advertisers, but also creators on YouTube. Dream Screen (creating image backgrounds for YouTube videos using AI) and YouTube Create (video publishing tools) can help creators cut time and find inspiration for higher-quality videos. Under Spotlight Moments (enabling advertisers to place their promotions within the most popular content around certain themes), AI can also be used to identify trending video content around major cultural moments for brand sponsorship opportunities. This requires AI-based video identification and sorting, which is likely to involve neural network methods such as Masked Autoencoders (MAE) built on Vision Transformers (ViT) as well as contrastive learning.</p> <h4 id="apple---ecosystem-expansion-customer-experience-services-arvr">Apple - Ecosystem Expansion (Customer Experience, Services, AR/VR)</h4> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/analytics_bigtechs_2024/apple.webp-480.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/analytics_bigtechs_2024/apple.webp-800.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/analytics_bigtechs_2024/apple.webp-1400.webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/analytics_bigtechs_2024/apple.webp" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" title="example image" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Apple ecosystem </div> <p>At Apple, expanding its ecosystem beyond hardware sales remains its top priority.
